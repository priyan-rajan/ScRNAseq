I generated a workflow for analysis of single cell RNA-seq data of immune cell populations present in 4T1 mouse breast tumors. I determined changes to transcriptome profile upon blockade of p38 by pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation. This work is part of a manuscript currently under review in Cancer Immunology Research.
